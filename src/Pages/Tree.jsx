      description="Trees are incredible environmental powerhouses with numerous benefits. A single mature tree can produce enough oxygen for ten people in one season and absorb up to one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime, significantly aiding in the fight against climate change. Trees support biodiversity, providing homes for 80% of the worldâ€™s terrestrial species. Spending time around trees and green spaces has been shown to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and improve mental well-being."
